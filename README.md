## Reverse a String

- Objective is to create a function that takes a string argument and return a reversed version of the string
- The last module was heavily focused on objects and arrays and I couldn't remember what to do with disassembling strings

```js
function reverseString(str) {       // function 'reverseString' takes a string as its argument
    let revStr = "";                // declare a new variable and assign an empty string. The reversed string will be assigned to the new variable
    for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { // let the value of i equal to the last character of the string. While i is greater than equal to 0, decrement i by 1
        revStr += str[i];           // concatenate the iterated value of the string to the remaining portion of the original string
    }
    return revStr;                  // return the reversed string
}

console.log(reverseString("hello world")); // "dlrow olleh"
```

- revStr += str[i] portion looks like this

```js
hello world     // Original string
hello worl + d
hello wor + dl
hello wo + dlr
hello w + dlro
hello + dlrow_  // Notice that it also accounts for whitespace
hell + dlrow o
hel + dlrow ol
he + dlrow oll
h + dlrow olle
dlrow olleh     // reversed string
```

## Factorialize a Number

- Return a factorial of a positive integer passed to the function

```js
function factorialize(num) { // Use recursive function 
    if (num === 0) {    // base case. If num strictly equals 0, return the result
        return 1;       // When base case is reached, the result will be multiplied by 1 and the function will stop execution
    }                   // It is viable to put an 'else' here but it doesn't seem necessary
    return num * factorialize(num - 1); // Multiply num by the function with decrementing num value until base case is reached
}

console.log(factorialize(5)); // 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```

## Find the Longest Word in a String

- create a function that takes a sentence as a string argument
- The function should return the number of the characters in the longest word in the sentence.

```js
function findLongestWordLength(str) {
    let longestLength = 0;  // Keep a count of the longest word length as it iterates through the string
    let currentLength = 0;  // Keep a count of the length of the current word

    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {  // Iterate through string
        if (str[i] === " ") {       // If the character at the current position of 'i' is whitespace (i.e. if it's the end of a word)
            if (currentLength > longestLength) {    // and if the current length of the word is greater than the longest length logged
                longestLength = currentLength;      // then the longestLength equals the value of the currentLength
            }
            currentLength = 0;  // reset the count value of the current length and loop through the function.
        } else {
            currentLength++;    // If above condition are not met (i.e. if it's still iterating through a word), move to the next character count
            /* If the code stops here, it is fine as long as the longest word is not at the end of the string.
            This is because the code is setup to update the longestLength variable only when it encounters a whitespace.
            Because of this setup, when it reaches the end of a string, it will not update the variable accordingly 
            even if the last word of the string is the longest in the sentence.
            Add the following 'if' statement AFTER the loop to check to see if the length of the current word (the last word of the string)
            is indeed the longest word of the string.*/
            if (currentLength > longestLength) {
                longestLength = currentLength;
            }
        }
    }
    return longestLength;
}
```

## Return Largest Number in Arrays

- An array containing sub-arrays is passed to a function.
- The function created should return the largest number in each array in a new array.

- declare a new array with an empty array
- iterate through the array and its sub-arrays (one subarray at a time)
- keep track of the largest number and compare to current number
- if largest number in a sub-array is found, push that number to the new array variable

```js
function largestOfFour(arr) {
    let newArr = [];    // declare a new variable 'newArr' with an empty array to which the largest number of each subarray will be added.

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {  // for loop to iterate through each subarray
        let largestNum = arr[i][0];
        /* largestNum variable is declared with value of arr at index [i][0].
        It is indicating where the iteration should begin.
        It is not 'arr[i][j]' since 'j' has not been declared yet.*/
        for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {   // for loop to iterate through each element of subarray
            if (arr[i][j] > largestNum) {   // if number value at 'arr[i][j]' is greater than the current largest number
                largestNum = arr[i][j];     // then reassign largestNum to the number value at the current 'arr[i][j] position
            }
        }
        newArr.push(largestNum);    // AFTER iterating through the first subarray, push largestNum of that subarray to 'newArr'. Then carry on.
        /* The placement of the push was a bit confusing at first. 
        Partly because the editor screen in FCC has the same color for all curly braces.
        It's a bit more clear in vscode.
        Placing the push anywhere above this line in the code will return unexpected results. 
        It will be constantly pushing numbers into 'newArr'
        At first I had 'newArr.push(arr[i][j]);' but the console would read 'j is not defined' since it's outside the 2nd for loop
        Then realized the 'arr[i][j]' is assigned to 'largestNum'.
        I have to get used to thinking through the logic of the problem. 
        Honestly, this one was a bit of a fluke.*/
    }
    return newArr;
}
```

## Confirm the Ending

- Create a function 'confirmEnding', which takes two strings (str, target) as its arguments.
- The objective of the function is to check if the first string argument (str) passed to the function ends with the second string argument (target)

- I need to iterate through the first string argument
- Iteration should be conducted backwards.

```js
function confirmEnding(str, target) {
  for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    for (let j = target.length -1; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (str[i] === target[j]) {
        return true;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    }

  }
  return str;
}
```

- Initially tried the above, and it failed.
- The problem is that if the last letter matches, it immediately returns true, even if the next character in sequence does not match.
- It needs to iterate through the entire target string before returning a result.
  
- But come to think of it, I think this is getting way too complex.
- There has to be a simpler method.

- if I subtract the length of target from the length of str, I could use that value to extract the number of characters from 'str' equal to that of 'target'.
- Then, if the value of the extraction from 'str' is equal to the value of 'target', return true.
- if not return false.
- use slice() method

```js
function confirmEnding(str, target) {
    let diff = str.length - target.length; //declare a variable and assign it the value of the diff. between the lengths of 'str' and 'target'
    let extract = str.slice(diff); //declare a variable and assign it the value of applying slice() to the string.
    // If a single parameter is passed to slice(), it will begin extraction from the character following the index position specified to the end of the string.
    // I found this to be pleasantly convenient.

    if (extract === target) { // if the value extracted through slice() is equivalent to the value of 'target'
        return true;         
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

- This passes, now looking at it in retrospect, I think it can be simplified without declaring variables.

```js
function confirmEnding(str, target) {
    return str.slice(str.length - target.length) === target;
}
```

- I still find declaring variables to be more readable.
- I guess it's because I still have trouble 'thinking' in JS. I need to see it visually.

- NOTE: looking at the solutions provided in FCC, if a negative number is provided as the first parameter to slice(), the offset is then backwards from the end of the string.

```js
function confirmEnding(str, target) {
    return str.slice(-target.length) === target;
}
```

## Repeat a String Repeat a String

- create a function that repeats a string (str) for 'num' times specified.
- It should return an empty string if num is not a positive number.

- I should use a loop to repeat the process 'num' times
- I should declare a new variable to 'store' the result

```js
function repeatStringNumTimes(str, num) {
    let newStr = "";        // declare a new variable to store the result
    while (num > 0) {       // while 'num' is greater than 0,
        newStr += str;      // append 'str' to 'newStr'
        num--;              // decrement 'num' by 1 after every loop until num = 0
    }
    return newStr;
}
```

## Truncate a String

- create a function that truncates a string (first argument) if it is longer than the specified max string length (second argument).
- The returned truncated string should end with ```...```
- If the 'num' value is greater than or equal to the string length, return the string.

- Declare a variable to return the result
- Use an if statement to determine whether the string length exceeds the max value
  - if it exceeds the max value, use slice() method to truncate the string and append '...'
  - if it does not exceed the max value, return the string.

```js
function truncateString(str, num) {
    let newStr = ""; // initialize a new variable. Strings are immutable.

    if (str.length > num) {
        newStr = str.slice(0, num).concat('...'); // wasn't sure if .concat() was going to work. Now I know it does!
    } else if(str.length <= num) { // 'if' is not really necessary. I just put it there for personal clarification
        newStr = str;
    }
    return newStr;
}
```

## Finders Keepers

- create a function that iterates through an array (arr) and returns the first element that returns 'true' for the function (func) passed to the function.
- If no element passes, return 'undefined'

- use a 'for' loop to iterate through the array passed to the function
- if 'num' returns 'true' when it is passed to the function that is passed through the function as it iterates through the array, return that 'num' in the array.
- If none of the 'num' values return true, return 'undefined'

```js
function findElement(arr, func) {
    for (let num = 0; num < arr.length; num++) { // for loop to iterate through given array
        if (func(arr[num]) === true) {  // if current 'num' of the array returns true for the function passed to the function
            return (arr[num]);  // return that 'num'
        }
    }
    return undefined;   // If none of the elements return true, return 'undefined'. Notice this return is placed outside of the loop. 
}
```

## Boo Who

- create a function that checks if the argument passed to the function is a 'boolean'
- Return true or false

- sounds simple enough but I had a bit of trouble with this one.
- For one thing, I didn't know that I had to use 'boolean' as a string to compare.
- I had the right idea initially, but it took me a while to figure out how to compare the (typeof bool) to 'boolean'.

- use an 'if' statement to check if the 'typeof' argument value is a "boolean".
- Return true if it is, false if not.

```js
function booWho(bool) {
    if ((typeof bool) === "boolean") { // I initially had 'if ((typeof bool) === true || false)', which was silly.
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

## Various Methods

- There are more and more methods that are mentioned in the challenges, but I have not yet been introduced to them.
- I guess it's time to start digging around and find out for myself.

### split()

- split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings.
- It takes two parameters

```js
string.split(separator, limit);
```

- The separator specifies the character(s) or regular expression used to determine where to split the string.
- If 'separator' is not specified, the entire string will be returned.
- The 'limit' parameter specifies the max number of splits to be performed.
- if not specified, all possible splits will be returned.

```js
const str = "apple, banana, orange, grape, kiwi";
const arr = str.split(",", 3);
console.log(arr); // ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
```

- In the above example, the string will be split at every ',', three times.

### toUpperCase() / toLowerCase()

- Append .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() to a variable assigned to a string to change the letter-casing

```js
someString.toUpperCase();
someString.toLowercase();
```

- It does not take any parameters

### .charAt()

- This method is used to extract a character specified by the passed parameter
- It uses zero-based indexing

```js
let string = "Hello world!";
console.log(string.charAt(4));   // 'l'
```

- if the specified parameter value is outside the range of valid indices, it will return an empty string.

### .join()

- .join() method works opposite to .split()
- It takes a separator parameter, which is used to join the elements of an array into a string.
- If the separator is not specified, it will use its default separator (',').

```js
const arr = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
const str = arr.join(" ");  // separate elements with a whitespace
console.log(str); // "apple banana orange"
```

## Title Case a Sentence

- Create a function that takes a sentence string and converts the first letter of every word to uppercase and remaining words to lowercase

```js
function titleCase(str) {
    let newArr = [];        // initialize a new variable 'newArr' with an empty array
    let splitArr = str.split(" ");  // initialize a new variable and assign it the result of splitting the string passed to the function. Separate with whitespace
  for (let i = 0; i < splitArr.length; i++) {   // setup the for loop to iterate through the split string
      if (/^[A-Z][a-z]*$/.test(splitArr[i])) {  // use regex to check if the first character of the current element is uppercase and the remaining are lowercase
          newArr.push(splitArr[i]);             // if the regex test returns true, push that element to 'newArr'
      } else {                                  // if the regex test does not return true
        splitArr[i] = splitArr[i].toLowerCase();    // Convert all characters of the current element to lowercase
        splitArr[i] = splitArr[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + splitArr[i].slice(1);
        // After converting to lowercase, extract the character at (charAt) index 0 and convert that character to uppercase.
        // Concatenate the character converted to uppercase with the result of slicing the current element at index 1.
        // .slice(1) will extract all characters from index 1 to the end of the string.
        newArr.push(splitArr[i]);   // push the newly updated string and push to 'newArr'
      }
  }
  return newArr.join(" ");  // Join the elements from 'newArr' with a whitespace between each element
}

console.log(titleCase("I'm a little tea pot")); // I'm A Little Tea Pot
```

- I'm sure there are much simpler methods.
- But this is what I have at the moment

## Slice and Splice

- create a function that takes two arrays and an index value as its arguments
- The function should take the elements of the first array and insert it into the second array in order.
- The insertion should begin at the index specified.
- The original arrays should not be modified.

```js
function frankenSplice(arr1, arr2, n) {
    let arr2Slice = arr2.slice(0);  // slice arr2 and assign it to a new variable to prevent modification of the original array
    for (let i = arr1.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { // Iterate through arr1 in reverse order
        arr2Slice.splice(n, 0, arr1[i]);    // Insert the iterated elements one by one into arr2Slice starting at index 'n'
    }
    return arr2Slice;
}

console.log(frankenSplice([1, 2, 3][4, 5, 6], 1));  // [4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
```

Shown below is what I originally had

```js
function frankenSplice(arr1, arr2, n) {
  let arr2Slice = arr2.slice(0);
  for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    arr2Slice.splice(n, 0, arr1[i]);
  }
  return arr2Slice;
}

console.log(frankenSplice([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 1)); // [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]
```

- I didn't take into account that each iterated element is inserted in to the same index 'n' position.
- Which in turn would 'push' the inserted elements.
- Reverse the loop iteration to reverse this effect.
